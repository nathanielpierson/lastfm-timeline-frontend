This project uses the last.fm API to make a timeline of when a user listened to certain albums in their rankings.
Measurements available through API are:
The last week, the last month, the last 3 months, the last 6 months, the last 12 months, forever

Using this limited data return, I designed this app to find albums that have play counts for multiple time periods and gathering those playcounts into one place. This project is run with an Express.js backend and a PostgreSQL database. the Express.js backend is available [here]((https://github.com/nathanielpierson/lastfm-backend-node-version)): https://github.com/nathanielpierson/lastfm-backend-node-version
I am also working on a live version of this project here: https://lastfm-charting-app-frontend.onrender.com
